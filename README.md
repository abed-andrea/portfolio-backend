# Portfolio Backend

Backend for my portfolio project.

## Initial Set Up
- Created a basic FastAPI backend
- Set up a virtual environment
- Installed dependencies and froze them in `requirements.txt`
- Implemented a simple `/hello` GET endpoint
- Ran the backend locally using Uvicorn
- Tested the endpoint successfully using Postman
- Containerized the backend using Docker and Docker Compose

## How to Run with Docker
Make sure Docker Desktop is running.

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd portfolio-backend

docker compose up --build
